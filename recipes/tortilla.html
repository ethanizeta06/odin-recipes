    <h1>Tortilla</h1>
    <img src="../images/tortilla.jpg">
    <p>A Spanish tortilla (or tortilla de patatas) is a traditional Spanish dish made of eggs, potatoes, and sometimes onions. The potatoes are thinly sliced, fried, and then mixed with beaten eggs, and the mixture is cooked into a thick, round omelet. Itâ€™s typically served at room temperature, as a tapa or main dish, and can be enjoyed warm or cold. Simple yet delicious, it's a staple in Spanish cuisine.</p>
